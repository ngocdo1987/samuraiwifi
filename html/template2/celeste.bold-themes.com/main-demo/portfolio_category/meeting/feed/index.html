		<description><![CDATA[Life coaching is not just some feel-good indulgence. It's a valid path to self improvement	that's helped countless people around the world create fulfilling lives.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bt_bb_wrapper"><p>Perhaps you&#8217;re reluctant about life coaching because you think the coach will heap criticism on you. That&#8217;s not what life coaching is about at all. With life coaching you&#8217;ll get someone who listens to your thoughts and goals. Then the coach helps you nurture yourself and plan for the future.</p>
<blockquote><p>When you seek life coaching help, you&#8217;re consciously stepping out of your hectic life. Working with a life coach gives you a chance to reflect on your personal strengths and challenges.</p></blockquote>
<p>How often do you ever get time to focus on your wants and needs? Life doesn&#8217;t stop for you to catch up unless you make it. And life coaching is an effective method for stopping the clock. Then you can discover how to enjoy each day more than ever before.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Motivational coaching teaches you the methods of successful people. The sources of their motivation are not secrets. And motivational coaches know what they are. With coaching you’ll unlock your motivation and start making smart decisions and setting goals.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bt_bb_wrapper"><p>During the coaching process you’ll envision your success more clearly. The coach will ask you questions that help you discover your true desires. From this knowledge, you’ll create crystal clear goals. Drawn forward by your own desire, your motivation will rise. And your goals will become reality.</p>
<p>Coaching helps you overcome common motivation killers like:</p>
<ul class="square-points">
<li>Overcome negative beliefs about yourself</li>
<li>Procrastination</li>
<li>Unclear or shifting goals</li>
<li>Lack of encouragement</li>
</ul>
<h3>How does coaching help you with your motivation?</h3>
<p>During motivational coaching you and the coach create a space where your ideas take center stage. Coaching is meant to help you refine your ideas so you can set realistic goals and go forward.</p>
<p>With motivational coaching you’ll learn to adopt positive thinking. Fear of failing will be replaced by enthusiasm for action. Setbacks will become learning opportunities and not reasons to quit. One of the most powerful parts of coaching is the support and encouragement it offers you.</p>
<p>You’ll discover that it’s good for you to develop yourself and pursue your goals. You don’t have to always set aside your dreams. Coaching empowers you to believe in yourself. This is the foundation of success.</p>
