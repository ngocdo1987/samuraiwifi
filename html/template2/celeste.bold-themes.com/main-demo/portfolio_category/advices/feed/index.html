The coach can help you figure out the sources of anger and disrespect.</p>
<p>With family coaching everyone gets to step back and take a deep breath. You’ll get a nonjudgmental opinion about what is going on. And then you’ll work with everyone to set up new rules for happiness.</p>
<p>It’s all too easy for family members to get exhausted and start snapping at each other. When you feel like your needs are being ignored, disrespect and anger result.</p>

<p>Family coaching is a process. It’ll take time for all family members to get on board with the new program. When there are setbacks, coaching encourages you to keep trying. The coach can also help you reassess your needs and make adjustments going forward.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Age-appropriate communication. </strong>Young children live in the moment and often can’t process what their parents are saying.</li>
<li><strong>Coordinated parenting.</strong> This puts both parents on the same page. Then kids know what’s expected instead of getting mixed signals.</li>
<li><strong>Anger management.</strong> You’ll get new tools for dealing with your frustrations and expressing your needs.</li>
<li><strong>Promoting the positive</strong>. Coaching shows you how to add more fun to your family life. Even when you’re busy, it’s important to schedule family time that is relaxing and rewarding.</li>
<li><strong>Work and life balance.</strong> Focusing too much on work will increase tension at home. Coaching helps you control stress and manage your time better.</li>

		<description><![CDATA[So many parents miss this out. I should know because I had two grown up boys that I missed to guide because of my “lack of time” during my younger years as a teenage father.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bt_bb_wrapper"><section id="bt_bb_section5aa4b7ab8c897"  class="bt_bb_section bt_bb_layout_wide bt_bb_vertical_align_top" ><div class="bt_bb_port"><div class="bt_bb_cell"><div class="bt_bb_cell_inner"><div  class="bt_bb_row" ><div  class="bt_bb_column col-md-12 col-ms-12 bt_bb_align_left bt_bb_vertical_align_top bt_bb_padding_normal"  data-width="12"><div class="bt_bb_column_content"><header class="bt_bb_headline bt_bb_dash_bottom bt_bb_size_normal bt_bb_align_inherit"><h2><span class="bt_bb_headline_content"><span>Being there for your child</span></span></h2></header><div class="bt_bb_separator bt_bb_bottom_spacing_normal bt_bb_border_style_none"></div><div  class="bt_bb_text" ><p>I was a failure in the past in this area, but I know its not yet too late for me to experience “Fatherhood.” By the grace of our creator, I was given another chance of becoming a father at my ripe age of 40s.</p>
<p>Most parents thought that the way to raising their kids was by ensuring that they have a good future. This means having to work hard to ensure that they get the best possible thing we can provide. However, we tend to believe that just by working or running your business, you are already a good parent.</p>
</div><div class="bt_bb_separator bt_bb_bottom_spacing_medium bt_bb_border_style_none"></div></div></div></div><div  class="bt_bb_row" ><div  class="bt_bb_column col-md-6 col-sm-12 bt_bb_align_left bt_bb_vertical_align_top bt_bb_padding_normal"  data-width="6"><div class="bt_bb_column_content"><div  class="bt_bb_text" ><p>We don&#8217;t take the time to explain that what we are doing is for them because we think they won&#8217;t understand.</p>
<p>What we do not know is that our kids simply need us to be there for them. They want us to be beside them when they run, when they fall, when they feel good, and when they feel bad.</p>
<ul>
<li>Believe me, no child has ever thanked God for a beautiful toy without his father.</li>
<li>No child has ever thanked God for a wonderful party at an expensive hotel without his Dad.</li>
<li>No child has ever thanked God enough for an award in school without his parents being present.</li>
</ul>

<p>The time we spend so hard earning money for them, is actually the same time they crave from us. They want to enjoy the things we have been trying to provide them with us!</p>
<p>We need to find time to do even the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stroll with them</li>
<li>Play with them</li>
<li>Eat lunch with them</li>
<li>Cry with them</li>
<li>Laugh with them</li>
<li>Do foolish childish things with them</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don&#8217;t ever set aside time for these things, then we have missed out the most important definition of love for them.</p>
<p>How they define love from what they experience from us, is most likely the same love they will show to their future family.</p>
<p>That is scary.</p>
<p>The same Dad who goes to work early in the morning and goes home very late at night from a drinking spree with his work comrades because of career politics will be replicated.  The same mom who goes home late from the pressured work and overtime to help the family make ends meet. The child&#8217;s definition of love will only be based on how we “demonstrated” it to them.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Relationship coaching gets you ready to succeed in love. Whether you’re dating or already deeply committed, coaching lets you make a fresh start.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bt_bb_wrapper"><p>You’ll learn how to let go of old baggage that will never make you happy. Coaching switches your focus to the future so the love of a soul mate can enrich your life.</p>
<p>Relationships have their emotional ups and downs. With relationship coaching you’ll learn how to stay mindful of your feelings. When you stay in touch with how you feel, you’ll be able to make deeper connections with your partner.</p>
<p>Coaching helps you become the best person you can be. After you learn how to love and appreciate yourself, you’ll bring this warmth to other people. This naturally makes you more attractive. And it will lessen the chance of misunderstandings and friction.</p>
<h3>Coaching helps you find and keep true love</h3>
<p>Relationship coaching gives you a chance to explore your feelings. You’ll get to find out what you really want for yourself. This knowledge will stop you from projecting your needs on others. Instead you’ll find a partner that is a perfect fit for your needs.</p>
<p>A crucial part of the coaching process is to improve your communication. Your partner wants to know how you feel. With coaching support you’ll learn to express yourself better.</p>
<p>Relationship coaching stops you from:</p>
<ul class="square-points">
<li>Bottling up your feelings</li>
<li>Arguing and blaming</li>
<li>Fearing commitment</li>
</ul>
<p>Communication is a two-way street. As well as learning how to express yourself, you’ll learn to listen. Relationship coaching teaches you to imagine your partner’s perspective too. This will make you more attentive. And when you’re tuned into your partner, you’ll become more compassionate and caring.</p>
<p>The relationship skills you develop through coaching will help you value love. You won’t take it for granted or think you’ll never find it. Instead you’ll see it as a positive goal that benefits you and adds beauty to someone else’s life too.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Motivational coaching teaches you the methods of successful people. The sources of their motivation are not secrets. And motivational coaches know what they are. With coaching you’ll unlock your motivation and start making smart decisions and setting goals.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bt_bb_wrapper"><p>During the coaching process you’ll envision your success more clearly. The coach will ask you questions that help you discover your true desires. From this knowledge, you’ll create crystal clear goals. Drawn forward by your own desire, your motivation will rise. And your goals will become reality.</p>
<p>Coaching helps you overcome common motivation killers like:</p>
<ul class="square-points">
<li>Overcome negative beliefs about yourself</li>
<li>Procrastination</li>
<li>Unclear or shifting goals</li>
<li>Lack of encouragement</li>
</ul>
<h3>How does coaching help you with your motivation?</h3>
<p>During motivational coaching you and the coach create a space where your ideas take center stage. Coaching is meant to help you refine your ideas so you can set realistic goals and go forward.</p>
<p>With motivational coaching you’ll learn to adopt positive thinking. Fear of failing will be replaced by enthusiasm for action. Setbacks will become learning opportunities and not reasons to quit. One of the most powerful parts of coaching is the support and encouragement it offers you.</p>
<p>You’ll discover that it’s good for you to develop yourself and pursue your goals. You don’t have to always set aside your dreams. Coaching empowers you to believe in yourself. This is the foundation of success.</p>
