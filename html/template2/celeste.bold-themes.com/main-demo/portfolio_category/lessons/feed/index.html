The coach can help you figure out the sources of anger and disrespect.</p>
<p>With family coaching everyone gets to step back and take a deep breath. You’ll get a nonjudgmental opinion about what is going on. And then you’ll work with everyone to set up new rules for happiness.</p>
<p>It’s all too easy for family members to get exhausted and start snapping at each other. When you feel like your needs are being ignored, disrespect and anger result.</p>

<p>Family coaching is a process. It’ll take time for all family members to get on board with the new program. When there are setbacks, coaching encourages you to keep trying. The coach can also help you reassess your needs and make adjustments going forward.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Age-appropriate communication. </strong>Young children live in the moment and often can’t process what their parents are saying.</li>
<li><strong>Coordinated parenting.</strong> This puts both parents on the same page. Then kids know what’s expected instead of getting mixed signals.</li>
<li><strong>Anger management.</strong> You’ll get new tools for dealing with your frustrations and expressing your needs.</li>
<li><strong>Promoting the positive</strong>. Coaching shows you how to add more fun to your family life. Even when you’re busy, it’s important to schedule family time that is relaxing and rewarding.</li>
<li><strong>Work and life balance.</strong> Focusing too much on work will increase tension at home. Coaching helps you control stress and manage your time better.</li>

		<description><![CDATA[Life coaching is not just some feel-good indulgence. It's a valid path to self improvement	that's helped countless people around the world create fulfilling lives.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bt_bb_wrapper"><p>Perhaps you&#8217;re reluctant about life coaching because you think the coach will heap criticism on you. That&#8217;s not what life coaching is about at all. With life coaching you&#8217;ll get someone who listens to your thoughts and goals. Then the coach helps you nurture yourself and plan for the future.</p>
<blockquote><p>When you seek life coaching help, you&#8217;re consciously stepping out of your hectic life. Working with a life coach gives you a chance to reflect on your personal strengths and challenges.</p></blockquote>
<p>How often do you ever get time to focus on your wants and needs? Life doesn&#8217;t stop for you to catch up unless you make it. And life coaching is an effective method for stopping the clock. Then you can discover how to enjoy each day more than ever before.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bt_bb_wrapper"><p>Life coaching combines the power of accountability, encouragement and planning to keep you motivated. If you slide back into old habits, the coach reminds you how to try again. Your focus will stay on action instead of excuses.</p>
<blockquote><p>The accountability comes with encouragement. You won&#8217;t be updating your life alone. You&#8217;ll have a coach to help you strive for positive change.</p></blockquote>
<p>Clear actions are defined during your coaching sessions so you&#8217;ll know what to do. Your motivation is constantly strengthened as you follow your life coaching plan. Every step you take toward your goals adds to your motivation.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Life Coaching is a powerful methodology designed to take you from where you are today to where you want to be. The speed and ease with which you can reach your goals and grow in life is accelerated when you work with a coach.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bt_bb_wrapper"><p>When considering a particular area of life, be it career, family, relationships, health, and so on, individuals fall into one of five camps:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. I don’t know what I want;<br />
2. I know what I want, but don’t know how to get it;<br />
3. I know what I want and how to get it, but something keeps holding me back;<br />
4. I know what I want, how to get it and I’m motivated and on track; and<br />
5. I know what I want and I’ve already got it!</p></blockquote>
<p>The life coaching process is most relevant and beneficial for those people falling into the first three camps above. A fundamental principle behind coaching is that each person knows best what they want. Friends, regardless of how well they may know you or whether they have your best interests at heart, still see your life from <em>their</em> perspective. Parents, mentors, counsellors and the like bring to the table their experiences and advise you on what you should do based on that. However, what may be relevant and important to them, may not always be equally so for you.</p>
<p>Call it gut-feel, intuition, or a hunch you generally do know what you want or don’t want at some level. It may not be at a conscious level, or worse yet it may be well hidden but at your very core you do know. An effective life coach is one who is able to help you access your own inner knowledge. In doing so, you establish what you really want in a particular scenario. The coaching techniques employed to do this vary from person to person and range from asking powerful open-ended questions and creative visualisation to considering the same subject from a variety of different perspectives.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Relationship coaching gets you ready to succeed in love. Whether you’re dating or already deeply committed, coaching lets you make a fresh start.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bt_bb_wrapper"><p>You’ll learn how to let go of old baggage that will never make you happy. Coaching switches your focus to the future so the love of a soul mate can enrich your life.</p>
<p>Relationships have their emotional ups and downs. With relationship coaching you’ll learn how to stay mindful of your feelings. When you stay in touch with how you feel, you’ll be able to make deeper connections with your partner.</p>
<p>Coaching helps you become the best person you can be. After you learn how to love and appreciate yourself, you’ll bring this warmth to other people. This naturally makes you more attractive. And it will lessen the chance of misunderstandings and friction.</p>
<h3>Coaching helps you find and keep true love</h3>
<p>Relationship coaching gives you a chance to explore your feelings. You’ll get to find out what you really want for yourself. This knowledge will stop you from projecting your needs on others. Instead you’ll find a partner that is a perfect fit for your needs.</p>
<p>A crucial part of the coaching process is to improve your communication. Your partner wants to know how you feel. With coaching support you’ll learn to express yourself better.</p>
<p>Relationship coaching stops you from:</p>
<ul class="square-points">
<li>Bottling up your feelings</li>
<li>Arguing and blaming</li>
<li>Fearing commitment</li>
</ul>
<p>Communication is a two-way street. As well as learning how to express yourself, you’ll learn to listen. Relationship coaching teaches you to imagine your partner’s perspective too. This will make you more attentive. And when you’re tuned into your partner, you’ll become more compassionate and caring.</p>
<p>The relationship skills you develop through coaching will help you value love. You won’t take it for granted or think you’ll never find it. Instead you’ll see it as a positive goal that benefits you and adds beauty to someone else’s life too.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Motivational coaching teaches you the methods of successful people. The sources of their motivation are not secrets. And motivational coaches know what they are. With coaching you’ll unlock your motivation and start making smart decisions and setting goals.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bt_bb_wrapper"><p>During the coaching process you’ll envision your success more clearly. The coach will ask you questions that help you discover your true desires. From this knowledge, you’ll create crystal clear goals. Drawn forward by your own desire, your motivation will rise. And your goals will become reality.</p>
<p>Coaching helps you overcome common motivation killers like:</p>
<ul class="square-points">
<li>Overcome negative beliefs about yourself</li>
<li>Procrastination</li>
<li>Unclear or shifting goals</li>
<li>Lack of encouragement</li>
</ul>
<h3>How does coaching help you with your motivation?</h3>
<p>During motivational coaching you and the coach create a space where your ideas take center stage. Coaching is meant to help you refine your ideas so you can set realistic goals and go forward.</p>
<p>With motivational coaching you’ll learn to adopt positive thinking. Fear of failing will be replaced by enthusiasm for action. Setbacks will become learning opportunities and not reasons to quit. One of the most powerful parts of coaching is the support and encouragement it offers you.</p>
<p>You’ll discover that it’s good for you to develop yourself and pursue your goals. You don’t have to always set aside your dreams. Coaching empowers you to believe in yourself. This is the foundation of success.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[People turn to life coaching because they are unclear about the direction their life is going in, they feel there is something missing. It’s my job as a coach to help them work out what that something is, and how they can find it.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bt_bb_wrapper"><p>All coaches have a series of tools at their disposal to help them do this, over the next few articles I’m going to be sharing some of these for you to use.</p>
<p>We all have secret worries and fears that we don’t want to share with our social circle but when you’re worried that your aspirations or goals will be judged by your closest friends you can start to hold yourself back. You might find yourself blocking your own goals. If you’ve started assuming that what you want simply isn’t possible, that you don’t deserve to go for it or that you should put others’ needs and desires before your own, then you’re probably not getting the most out of your life. Putting our needs behind those of others is something we do in all aspects of our lives. From work, to our families, to sex &#8211; we can get caught up in trying to please other people and ignore our own needs.</p>
<p>One way I ask clients to think bigger about what they want is through future-self exercises, these are exercises that encourage you to think as if you had already achieved what it is you’re working towards. This isn’t about being your ‘best’ or ‘perfect’ future self, God knows there is already so much pressure to be this. This is about giving yourself time to explore what’s possible and being really honest about what you want.</p>
<p>Here’s one exercise that I ask clients to do early on in coaching, it’s an effective way to clearly show what you need to do to achieve your goals.</p>
<blockquote><p>Write a letter and imagine where you want to be a year today. Imagine what your life looks like, what you’ve achieved and what you’ve had to do to get there. Then write a letter from your future self to your present self.</p></blockquote>
<p>You want this letter to resonate so here are three steps to getting it right:</p>
<ol>
<li>Write down your goals and what your life looks like when you’re not tolerating it and you are completely happy and you’ve achieved everything you want to. You can be as creative as you like, you’re the only person who will read this so don’t hesitate to put in everything you want.</li>
<li>When writing the letter take yourself out of your day to day environment and go somewhere that allows you to dream big. Go somewhere you find inspiring and beautiful to write the letter, take your time and write without editing or censoring. Don’t cross things out or start again, this isn’t about a writing competition, nobody is grading you on your grammar or the realism of your work.</li>
<li>Don’t judge what you have written as good or bad, possible or impossible. It’s just what’s here right now. Holding back this judgement opens to the door to being honest with yourself about what really makes you happy, and what you really have to do to achieve it. When you read the letter back to yourself, we want for you to feel inspired and energized by what you have written – this doesn’t want to feel like pressure, more like hope.</li>
<li>Now you’ve completed the letter, there are a few things you can do to bring it alive. Keep it where you can see it regularly, and re-read it from time to time to remind yourself of your goals. You can break it down, maybe try splitting the year into quarters with goals for each month. Something I like to do is to share my letter with someone I trust – a coach or a close ally who will champion me and hold me accountable. And there’s a great website called futureme.org – if you post your letter on there, you will get it sent back to your inbox in one year from the date you posted.</li>
</ol>
<p>Good luck and enjoy!</p>
