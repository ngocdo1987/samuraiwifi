		<description><![CDATA[Life coaching is not just some feel-good indulgence. It's a valid path to self improvement	that's helped countless people around the world create fulfilling lives.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bt_bb_wrapper"><p>Perhaps you&#8217;re reluctant about life coaching because you think the coach will heap criticism on you. That&#8217;s not what life coaching is about at all. With life coaching you&#8217;ll get someone who listens to your thoughts and goals. Then the coach helps you nurture yourself and plan for the future.</p>
<blockquote><p>When you seek life coaching help, you&#8217;re consciously stepping out of your hectic life. Working with a life coach gives you a chance to reflect on your personal strengths and challenges.</p></blockquote>
<p>How often do you ever get time to focus on your wants and needs? Life doesn&#8217;t stop for you to catch up unless you make it. And life coaching is an effective method for stopping the clock. Then you can discover how to enjoy each day more than ever before.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Getting life coaching advice could easily be one of the best things you ever do for yourself. Coaching opens doors for self empowerment that no one has ever shown you before.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bt_bb_wrapper"><p>Life coaching combines the power of accountability, encouragement and planning to keep you motivated. If you slide back into old habits, the coach reminds you how to try again. Your focus will stay on action instead of excuses.</p>
<blockquote><p>The accountability comes with encouragement. You won&#8217;t be updating your life alone. You&#8217;ll have a coach to help you strive for positive change.</p></blockquote>
<p>Clear actions are defined during your coaching sessions so you&#8217;ll know what to do. Your motivation is constantly strengthened as you follow your life coaching plan. Every step you take toward your goals adds to your motivation.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Parenting is tough whether you are a single parent with five kids or a married couple with one child.  We often react with anger or frustration when are children are misbehaving.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bt_bb_wrapper"><p>I confess I have done this one more than one occasion. It’s almost an instinct to yell at your child to get their attention.</p>
<p>I know I am about ready to scream when my shoulders tense, my jaw clenches, and my breathing starts to move at a rapid pace.</p>
<p>I have found that if I pause for a moment and take a few breaths I will handle the situation in a more positive manner. I call this the Peaceful Parent Pause.</p>
<p>When a situation arrives that has you upset follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Stop (pause).</li>
<li>Breathe.</li>
<li>Reflect on the situation.</li>
<li>React with positive intent or walk away.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember we are constantly teaching our children. One way that they learn is from observing us as parents. If we choose to react in a calm route, they will choose to react in a positive manner when they are in situations in their social context.</p>
<p>Good Luck with your next chance to practice the Peaceful Parent Pause.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Confidence coaching is all about making a plan for future achievement. You and the coach will talk about issues that are holding you back, but only so you can shift your focus away from the negative. ]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bt_bb_wrapper"><p>Coaching is the process of designing solutions and new strategies going forward. This is a very liberating path. And every new success will increase your confidence. You’ll discover how much you can do. And the coach will be there to applaud your efforts.</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s harder to slip back into old habits when you have coaching support. The coach helps you deal with any setbacks and gets you to keep trying.</p></blockquote>
<p>Confidence coaching can quickly reverse your self defeating attitude. And as your confidence grows, you’ll like yourself more than ever before.</p>
