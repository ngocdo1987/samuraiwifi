		<description><![CDATA[Personal and professional coaching, which has emerged as a powerful career in the last several years, has shifted the paradigm of how people who seek help with life transitions find a "helper" to partner with them in designing their desired future.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bt_bb_wrapper"><p>No matter what kind of sub-specialty a coach might have, life coaching is the basic operating system: a whole-person, client-centered approach. Here, Pat Williams, who has been a leader in the life coaching movement, has co-authored another essential book for therapists working as coaches. Becoming a Professional Life Coach draws on the wisdom of years of collective experience that have gone into designing the curriculum for the Institute for Life Coach Training. This curriculum has trained therapists and psychologists around the world to add coaching to their current businesses. This book presents the essential elements of life coach training program in a content-rich form that is equivalent to a graduate-level education in the field.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bt_bb_wrapper"><p>Targeted discovery tools to help you get clear on who you are, what you need, what you’re great at and what matters most to you—and how to get more of that. Perspective, support, accountability and inspiration from a coach who gets where you’re at, cares where you’re headed — and shares your desire to create what you want and need. New possibilities.  Clarity. Direction. Accountability. Accomplishment. Thriving, not surviving.</p>
