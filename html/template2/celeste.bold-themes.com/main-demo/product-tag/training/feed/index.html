		<description><![CDATA[Podcasting operational change management inside of workflows to establish a framework. Taking seamless key performance indicators offline to maximise the long tail.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bt_bb_wrapper"><p>Leverage agile frameworks to provide a robust synopsis for high level overviews. Iterative approaches to corporate strategy foster collaborative thinking to further the overall value proposition. Organically grow the holistic world view of disruptive innovation via workplace diversity and empowerment.</p>
<p>Bring to the table win-win survival strategies to ensure proactive domination. At the end of the day, going forward, a new normal that has evolved from generation X is on the runway heading towards a streamlined cloud solution. User generated content in real-time will have multiple touchpoints for offshoring.</p>
<p>Capitalize on low hanging fruit to identify a ballpark value added activity to beta test. Override the digital divide with additional clickthroughs from DevOps. Nanotechnology immersion along the information highway will close the loop on focusing solely on the bottom line.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Personal and professional coaching, which has emerged as a powerful career in the last several years, has shifted the paradigm of how people who seek help with life transitions find a "helper" to partner with them in designing their desired future.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bt_bb_wrapper"><p>No matter what kind of sub-specialty a coach might have, life coaching is the basic operating system: a whole-person, client-centered approach. Here, Pat Williams, who has been a leader in the life coaching movement, has co-authored another essential book for therapists working as coaches. Becoming a Professional Life Coach draws on the wisdom of years of collective experience that have gone into designing the curriculum for the Institute for Life Coach Training. This curriculum has trained therapists and psychologists around the world to add coaching to their current businesses. This book presents the essential elements of life coach training program in a content-rich form that is equivalent to a graduate-level education in the field.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Clarity, discovery and forward movement through 45-minute coaching sessions that you pre-purchase and schedule as you go]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bt_bb_wrapper"><p>Targeted discovery tools to help you get clear on who you are, what you need, what you’re great at and what matters most to you—and how to get more of that. Perspective, support, accountability and inspiration from a coach who gets where you’re at, cares where you’re headed — and shares your desire to create what you want and need. New possibilities.  Clarity. Direction. Accountability. Accomplishment. Thriving, not surviving.</p>
