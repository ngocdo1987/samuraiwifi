		<description><![CDATA[Bestselling author Steve Chandler (Fearless, The Joy of Selling) reveals the hidden power behind the world's hottest new profession: life coaching. His entertaining style and personal history in coaching offer delightful revelations about the way life coaching differs from psychotherapy and counseling.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bt_bb_wrapper"><p>Chandler seasons his book with provocative interviews with master coaches like Stephen McGhee, Peleg Top, Ron Wilder and Rich Litvin to give the reader fascinating insights into how and why coaching is so effective and popular right now as a way for common people to get the same success advantage that athletes and actors have always had. Chandler also makes a revealing distinction between managing and coaching within an organization. Managers control people and coaches empower people, which is why so many coaches, including Chandler, have been hired by companies to come in and work with leaders on integrating coaching into their management practices. This is the book the world has been waiting for on the subject of personal success coaching.</p>
