		<description><![CDATA[Save your marriage for less than what you spend going out to eat every week.

Imagine putting together a swing set for your children. Most of us don't read instructions we look at the picture and go from there. If we don't read the instruction manual, how would we know if we’re missing any tools to properly assemble the “set” if we aren’t carefully going step by step.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bt_bb_wrapper"><p>We get the swing set to look like the picture. But when the elements starts to hit or pressure is applied or our kids come  along we see just how shaky the set is. We notice it can&#8217;t handle the weight, temperament or the wind that it is being exposed to all because we left out one of the most important qualities to building this swing set: Properly reading the manual first.</p>
<p>Because of our lack of diligence our children are now getting hurt on the swing set we put together what we thought was with love, naively.</p>
<p>The same thing happens with our marriages. We put them together without reading the instruction manual. We go off our own interpretation on how &#8220;we&#8221; think our marriage is supposed to be.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Personal and professional coaching, which has emerged as a powerful career in the last several years, has shifted the paradigm of how people who seek help with life transitions find a "helper" to partner with them in designing their desired future.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bt_bb_wrapper"><p>No matter what kind of sub-specialty a coach might have, life coaching is the basic operating system: a whole-person, client-centered approach. Here, Pat Williams, who has been a leader in the life coaching movement, has co-authored another essential book for therapists working as coaches. Becoming a Professional Life Coach draws on the wisdom of years of collective experience that have gone into designing the curriculum for the Institute for Life Coach Training. This curriculum has trained therapists and psychologists around the world to add coaching to their current businesses. This book presents the essential elements of life coach training program in a content-rich form that is equivalent to a graduate-level education in the field.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[Your bucket list. Quarterly objectives. Strategic plans. Big dreams. Goals. Lots of goals and plans to achieve those goals--no matter what. Except ... You're not chasing the goal itself, you're actually chasing the feeling that you hope achieving that goal will give you.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bt_bb_wrapper"><p>Which means we have the procedures of achievement upside down. We go after the stuff we want to have, get, or accomplish, and we hope that we&#8217;ll be fulfilled when we get there. It&#8217;s backwards. And it&#8217;s burning us out.</p>
<p>So what if you first got clear on how you actually wanted to feel in your life, and then created some &#8220;Goals with Soul&#8221;?</p>
<p>With The Desire Map, Danielle LaPorte brings you a holistic life-planning tool that will revolutionize the way you go after what you want in life. Unapologetically passionate and with plenty of warm wit, LaPorte turns the concept of ambition inside out and offers an inspired, refreshingly practical workbook for using the Desire Map process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify your &#8220;core desired feelings&#8221; in every life domain: livelihood &amp; lifestyle, body &amp; wellness, creativity &amp; learning, relationships &amp; society, and essence &amp; spirituality</li>
<li>Create practical &#8220;Goals with Soul&#8221; to generate your core desired feelings</li>
<li>Why easing up on your expectations actually liberates you to reach your goals</li>
<li>Self-assessment quizzes, worksheets, and complete Desire Mapping tools for creating the life you truly long for</li>
<li>Goal-setting just got a makeover.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are more than 10,000 &#8220;Desire Mappers&#8221; who have worked through this system. &#8220;Every day I get stories about inner clarity, quitting jobs, dumping the chump, renewing vows, pole-dancing classes, writing memoirs, moving on,&#8221; says Danielle. &#8220;This is about liberation. And pleasure. And self-determination. This is about doing much less proving, and way more living.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve had enough of trying to trick yourself into happiness through affirmations or bucket-listing your hopes into some distant future, then you&#8217;re ready for The Desire Map&#8211;a dream-fulfilling system that harnesses your soul-deep desire to feel good.</p>

		<description><![CDATA[What if you knew you didn't need an expensive car or have to visit a monastery to be happy? What if you can actually access lasting unconditional happiness by being in the present moment?]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bt_bb_wrapper"><p>Most people look for happiness in the wrong places. They think happiness is dependent on material wealth or it&#8217;s something that&#8217;s about to come in the future. The mind is clouded with so many anxious thoughts and negative emotions. It&#8217;s almost impossible to appreciate the beauty of the present moment and the little things that make life wonderful. By harnessing the power of the Now, you can actually find true happiness that can transcend all the external things of the world.</p>
<p>In Eliza Palmer&#8217;s new book, The Path to Happiness, she talks about looking for happiness in the present moment. The book is here to teach you that your happiness is not dependent on the external world. You don&#8217;t need to worry about the past or feel anxious about the future. All you need is the present moment. But what is a journey without obstacles?</p>
<p>There will be hurdles that will come as negative thoughts, opinions of others, and suffering. Palmer&#8217;s book will help you eliminate these through meditation rituals and thought pattern modification. As a result, you will become more focused in the present and it will become easier for you to appreciate the world around.</p>
