		<description><![CDATA[No matter how long you have been a successful business professional, a job interview can be nerve wracking. Itâ€™s normal to feel the pressure of being analyzed by a hiring manager, but sometimes anxiety can cause us to make mistakes. Here are 3 mistakes to avoid for a successful interview.]]></description>
				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="bt_bb_wrapper"><p>As anyone who has been in a job search for a while knows, being invited to a job interview is not something easily achieved. Becoming one of the few &#8220;job candidates&#8221; rather than being part of the usually gigantic crowd of &#8220;job applicants&#8221; is a major victory.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, too many job candidates blow their interview opportunities, wasting all that time and effort. Don&#8217;t be one of those candidates. Never assume that the job offer is &#8220;in the bag&#8221; simply because you were invited for an interview!</p>
<h3>Avoid these common mistakes to land that job</h3>
<p>What you do during a job interview is viewed as a &#8220;sample&#8221; of your work. Everything you do is being judged because they don&#8217;t know you (unless you are one of the lucky referred candidates).</p>
<p>Show them you would be a great hire. Don&#8217;t make these mistakes:</p>
<h4>Mistake #1: Appearing uninterested.</h4>
<p>This drives employers crazy. Most employers have more applicants than they need or want.</p>
<p>If you aren&#8217;t demonstrably interested in them, they certainly aren&#8217;t interested in hiring you.</p>
<p><strong>Instead:</strong> Demonstrate your interest in the company and the job. Show up on time, appropriately dressed. Turn off your cell phone.</p>
<h4>Mistake #2: Being unprepared.</h4>
<p>Obvious lack of preparation is an opportunity crusher. And, lack of preparation usually becomes obvious quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Instead:</strong> Be prepared! Preparation will help you demonstrate your interest in them and the job. You will also perform better in the interview when you are prepared.</p>
<h4>Mistake #3: Being angry.</h4>
<p>Angry people are NOT people employers want to hire. Angry people are not fun to work with. They may frighten co-workers and/or customers or clients. They may also abuse both people and equipment (computers, cars, etc.). Not good contributors to a happy workplace or a prosperous business, even if they don&#8217;t &#8220;go postal.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Instead:</strong> If you are angry over a job loss, horrible commute to the interview, earlier fight with your kids or spouse, or anything else, dump the anger before the interview, at least temporarily.</p>
